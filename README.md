## InStock

Instock is a warehouse and inventory management system that was built in a week by a team of four developers using Agile work flows (Jira) and GitFlow. Every morning we would have a stand-up to mimic a work environment. I really enjoyed working with Jira, gitFLow and Scrum methodologies. It really allowed us to take a project that felt daunting at the time and break it down into more manageable bite sized pieces. Instock is a fully responsive full-stack web application.
